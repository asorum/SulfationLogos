# SulfationLogos

This code is used to generate and display Sulfation Logos as described in Wang et al. Nat Chem (2023).

Data from microarrays should be normalized and formatted according to example data file (Example Data - FGF2.csv). To run the program, users should place data file (.csv), Sulfated Matrix.csv, Unsulfated Matrix.csv and jupyter notebook (Sulfation Logo Program.ipynb) into the same folder before use. Generated 'Sulfation Logos' are output as .svg files.

We have provided an example dataset and the corresponding 'Sulfation Logo' output for reference and testing of code.
